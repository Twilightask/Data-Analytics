# Data Analysis using Python,SQL and Power BI

This repository showcases various data cleaning and analysis projects using MySQL, Python, and Excel. Each project focuses on handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and optimizing datasets for accurate analysis. The goal is to ensure high-quality, structured data for better decision-making and insights.

## Installation

Requirements:

Python 3.x (with pandas and numpy libraries).

MySQL database.

Power BI for visualizing the final data insights.

Git for cloning the repository and version control.


    
## Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the project on a Windows machine:

Step 1: Install Python
Download the latest version of Python.

Install Python by running the downloaded installer and ensuring that the "Add Python to PATH" option is selected during the installation process.

Verify the installation by running the following command in Command Prompt:
python --version


Step 2: Install MySQL

Download MySQL Installer.

Install MySQL by following the installation wizard, selecting MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench during the process.

Set up a root password and note it down, as you will need it later.
Verify the installation by opening MySQL Workbench and logging in with your root credentials.


Step 3: Clone the Repository

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Navigate to the directory where you want to place the project files:
cd path_to_your_directory


Step 4: Install Project Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries. Open Command Prompt and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install libraries such as pandas, numpy, etc.


Step 5: Set Up MySQL Database


Step 6: Running the Data Cleaning Script


Step 7: Data Analysis
Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.

Run SQL queries using the cleaned data for analysis (examples provided in the repository).


Step 8:Visualization with Power BI
Download and install Power BI Desktop from here.
Open the Example.pbix file from the project folder.

Power BI will automatically load the visuals, allowing you to explore the data interactively.

If needed, adjust the dataset connection by going to Home > Transform Data > Data Source Settings.

Step 9: Running the Project
Ensure all dependencies are installed and the MySQL database is set up.

Follow the instructions in the Usage section to clean the data, run SQL analysis, and view.




## Features

Data Cleaning: Accurate handling of null values, outliers, and duplicates.

SQL Analysis: Efficient querying of large datasets.

Interactive Dashboards: Visual representations of the data using Power BI, including filtering and drill-down capabilities.

Predictive Analytics (Upcoming): Integration of machine learning models to forecast future trends based on historical data.



## Project Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will:

Gain practical experience in data cleaning using Python.

Understand how to structure and run SQL queries in MySQL.

Develop skills in creating compelling data visualizations using Power BI.

Learn to present actionable insights from data through interactive dashboards.
